		<div class="method">
			<p>
				Lehmer's method is a type of "Prime Modulus Multiplicative Linear Congruential Generator"
				which operates in a multiplicative group of integers modulo $m$. The genious of Lehmer's
				algorithm is that if the multiplier $a$ and prime modulus $m$ are properly chosen, the
				resulting sequence $\{x_n\}$ will be
				<span class="bold">statistically indistinguishable</span> from a sequence drawn at random
				from the set $\{1, 2, ..., m-1\}$.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>The recursive formula applied in the method is:</p>
			<br />
			$$x_{n+1} = ax_n \mod m.$$

			<br />
			<p>
				There are many ways of choosing the numbers $a$, $m$ and the seed $x_0$. Different values
				would cause the method to reach its <span class="underlined">period</span> faster when such
				numbers are not "good enough".
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's take an example: $a=6$, $m=13$ and $x_0=1$; The resulting sequence is $\{1, 6, 10, 8,
				9, 2, 12, 7, 3, 5, 4, 11, 1, ...\}$, which has a period of $12$.
			</p>
			<br />

			<h3>Choosing $a, m$ and $x_0$</h3>

			<p>
				In general we want our choice of $m$ to be the highest possible prime number, this comes,
				however, at a big computing cost. For this reason, it's very common to work with numbers $m$
				that are a power of $2$. Doing so guarantees us that the period would be
				<span class="bold">at most</span> $m/4$, which is pretty low, but this period would be even
				smaller when $m$ is even. Due to this, a good option for $m$ is, for example $m = 2^{31}-1 =
				2147483647$.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				The best choice for $x_0$ is to make it coprime with $m$, this becomes a trivial task when
				$m$ is prime and a bit more complicaten when it is not. Lehmer suggested $a=7^{5}=16807$ and
				$m=2^{31}-1$, which is a Mersenne prime number and $0< x_0< 2^{31}-1$. This choice of $a$
				generates a full period function, which means it'll have a period of $m-1$
			</p>
			<br />

			<h3>Drawing the sequence</h3>
			<p>
				You can now choose different values for $a$, $m$ and $x_0$ and the drawing will paint each
				pixel black or white depending on weather the random number generated is smaller or greater
				than $0.5$. A bad choice of $a$, $m$ and $x_0$ will result in an image with a recognizable
				pattern.
